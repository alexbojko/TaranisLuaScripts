1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/cemizm/TaranisLuaScripts/archive/master.zip">telemetry screen script</a>
2. Create a folder on the radio microSD card called SCRIPTS (if it does not already exist)
3. Put the <b>content</b> of the AnySense folder into /SCRIPTS/ folder
4. Rename the modelname folder to the same name as the model that will use the script
5. If needed, modify the settings section in the telem1.lua

That is it. The new telemetry screen should now automatically appear for the model.

The telem2.lua script is just an example how to split the AnySense combined value.
